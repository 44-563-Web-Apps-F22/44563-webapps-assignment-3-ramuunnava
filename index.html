 While developing, most of the CSS I interact with does not have comments, besides the occasional header. As a result, I have gotten in the habit of not commenting my CSS.
However, I often find it would be useful to have comments in CSS that I am working with. Should you comment CSS besides a header indicating an author? If so, how?
I am not asking the process of how to comment, but rather the best practice.
