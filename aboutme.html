    <h5>RRR is my favorite movie</h5>
    <p>Set in Delhi during the early 1920s, “RRR” follows two patriotic but philosophically opposed men (Ram Charan, left, and N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) who team up to rescue a kidnapped girl from British colonial officials.
        It’s also fitting that “RRR” is Rajamouli’s big breakthrough since it's inevitably about Bheem as an inspiring symbol of quasi-traditional, boundary-trampling patriotism. Rajamouli has gotten quite good at incorporating potentially alienating elements,
        like his cheap-seats love of grisly violence and brash sloganeering, into his propulsive, inventive, and visually assured fight scenes and dance numbers.
